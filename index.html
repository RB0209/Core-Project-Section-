        In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted lives across the globe, the CARE Foundation launched Niyati – Feed the Need, 
        a humanitarian initiative to combat hunger and support vulnerable communities. Born from compassion during one of history’s greatest crises, 
        Niyati addressed urgent needs—from food insecurity to the sudden loss of income and basic essentials. 
        What began as a rapid emergency response quickly transformed into a long-term mission rooted in dignity, consistency, and community care. 
        From 2020 to 2025, Niyati has reached over 10,000 individuals and families, delivering food kits, essential supplies, and most importantly, hope. 
        This initiative became more than just numbers—it became a symbol of trust, resilience, and shared humanity.
        Even today, Niyati – Feed the Need continues to grow, evolving into a movement that envisions a hunger-free future. 
        Every ration kit delivered is a step closer to a world where no one sleeps hungry.

        In a bid to preserve the dignity of India's national flag, CARE Foundation has embarked on a noteworthy initiative. 
        Founded on the principles of respect and patriotism, this NGO has taken up the task of collecting flags that have fallen anywhere across the nation. 
        Their efforts extend beyond mere collection; they conduct rallies and awareness campaigns to educate citizens about flag etiquette and the significance of respecting national symbols. 
        The initiative not only aims to prevent desecration but also promotes a sense of pride and unity among Indians. 
        By organizing rallies, CARE Foundation spreads awareness about proper flag handling and disposal methods, ensuring that the tricolor is treated with the utmost respect throughout its lifecycle. 
        Moreover, the NGO collaborates with local communities and authorities to facilitate the proper disposal of collected flags, adhering to the guidelines set by the Flag Code of India. 
        This holistic approach not only preserves the sanctity of the national flag but also instills a deep sense of responsibility towards national symbols among citizens. 
        CARE Foundation's dedication to this cause serves as a beacon of civic responsibility and patriotism, inspiring others to uphold the honor and dignity of India's cherished emblem.

        CARE Foundation's Project ASHA stands as a poignant tribute to the legacy of Late Mrs. Asha Anil Bhatkal, a revered social worker whose compassion and dedication touched countless lives. 
        This initiative embodies her spirit by offering crucial support across three vital categories: Educational Scholarship, Medical Subsidy, and Micro Finance, aimed at uplifting underprivileged individuals and fostering empowerment, especially among women. 
        The Educational Scholarship component of Project ASHA aims to bridge gaps in access to education, providing deserving students with financial support to pursue their academic ambitions. 
        This initiative not only enhances educational opportunities but also cultivates a skilled workforce poised to contribute positively to society. 
        In tandem, the Medical Subsidy facet ensures that healthcare remains accessible to those in need, alleviating the financial burden of medical expenses and ensuring timely treatment for vulnerable communities. 
        Moreover, Project ASHA's Micro Finance initiative empowers individuals by offering financial assistance to start or expand small businesses, thereby promoting economic self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship within marginalized populations. 
        In its commitment to women's empowerment, Project ASHA prioritizes initiatives that support women in becoming economically independent and employable. 
        By offering vocational training and collaborating with organizations to introduce diverse vocational courses, CARE Foundation equips women with the skills needed to thrive in today's competitive job market. 
        As Project ASHA continues to evolve, its collaborative efforts with various organizations aim to expand its impact and reach more individuals in need. 
        By fostering partnerships and leveraging resources, CARE Foundation amplifies its capacity to create lasting change and uplift communities. 
        Through Project ASHA, CARE Foundation not only honors the legacy of Mrs. Asha Anil Bhatkal but also embodies its mission to empower, support, and uplift individuals across society, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to lead a dignified and fulfilling life.
